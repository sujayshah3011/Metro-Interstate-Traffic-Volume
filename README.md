# Metro-Interstate-Traffic-Volume
This project aims to analyze traffic congestion data on Interstate 94 Westbound to understand the factors affecting traffic volume.  By leveraging this data, we aim to provide insights and recommendations for improving urban mobility in line with Sustainable  Development Goal (SDG) 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities.

## Project Overview
Urban mobility is integral to the development of sustainable cities and communities. Traffic congestion is a widespread issue in many urban areas, leading to increased air pollution, reduced quality of life, and economic losses. This project aims to analyze traffic congestion data to identify patterns, causes, and potential solutions to enhance urban mobility. By leveraging advanced data analysis tools and methodologies, the project seeks to propose actionable solutions that align with Sustainable Development Goal 11 (SDG 11): Sustainable Cities and Communities.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Python**: Data cleaning, analysis, and visualization using Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Documenting the analysis process and visualizations.
- **Scikit-learn**: Developing predictive models and machine learning algorithms.

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection**: Gather traffic congestion data from various sources and compile weather, incident, and other relevant data.
2. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the data.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Perform descriptive statistical analysis and visualize temporal and spatial trends.
4. **Cause Identification**: Use correlation analysis and regression models to identify potential causes of traffic congestion.
5. **Predictive Modeling**: Develop machine learning models to predict future traffic congestion levels.
6. **Solution Development**: Propose solutions such as intelligent traffic management systems, promotion of public transportation, and infrastructure improvements.
7. **Reporting and Presentation**: Compile findings into a comprehensive report and create visualizations and interactive dashboards.

## Outcomes
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Detailed analysis identifying key causes and patterns of urban traffic congestion.
- **Predictive Models**: Reliable models for predicting future traffic congestion levels.
- **Actionable Solutions**: Data-driven solutions and policy recommendations.
- **Impact Assessment**: Evaluation of the potential impact of proposed solutions on SDG 11.
- **Awareness and Engagement**: Increased awareness among policymakers and the public.
